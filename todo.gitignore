** Add descriptions and spacing for each picture in the gallery

** Add #_target functionality to each nav bar icon

** Develop the shipping, return, and contact section.

** Develop the footer.

** No global selectors allowed. .class and #id only. Nor absolute positioning.

** Delivery section should provide covid assurances

*** Warranty Creation:
** Items valued over $15 that include a warranty or service contract must contain additional details in their listing description. You need to include one of the following:

The full text of the written warranty or service contract
A statement explaining how to get a free copy of the written warranty or service contract upon written request


** Mobile description, need to squeeze this in somehow:
<div vocab="https://schema.org/" typeof="Product">
<span property="description">
	This paragraph contains almost 800 characters of text to be displayed in the mobile item description.
	And the text in this paragraph through this sentence contains 250 characters, which is the amount we
	will display without any actions on your part. When you tag a paragraph with these HTML breaks, the 
	content will be displayed to shoppers looking at your item. This will allow the shopper to see the 
	key information you want to display, without them having to click through to the complete description. 
	If your complete description is 800 characters or less and uses basic HTML we will display the entire 
	description without any action on your behalf â€“ so the best practice is to keep it within 800 characters. 
	If you have a long description, make it easy for your buyers by using this option.
</span>
</div>
